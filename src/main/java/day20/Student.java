        1)Object-Oriented Programming Language(OOP) has 4 main principals
            i)Encapsulation  ii)Polymorphism  iii)Inheritance  iv)Abstraction
        2)Encapsulation: Data hiding
            i)Some data needs to be hidden like SSN, password, username...
            ii)By hiding some data we make our codes more readable
            iii)Encapsulation gives us flexibility
        3)How to hide data
            By using "private" access modifier, we can hide the data
        4)After hiding data how can you use it?
            After hiding data by the help of the getters we can access to encapsulated data
            Note: getter methods i)Should have "public" access modifier
                                 ii)It's return type must be same with the data type of the variable
                                 iii)getter methods are named like "get + capitalized variable name"
                                     But if the data type is boolean getter methods are named like "is + capitalized variable name"
                                 iv)getter methods do not use any parameter because they return the value of existing variable
        5)After hiding data how can we update it?
          After hiding data by the help of the setters we can update to encapsulated data
        6)To do encapsulation follow the given 5 steps inside the class
          1)Create private variables
          2)Create constructors you need
          3)Create getters
          4)Create setters
          5)Create toString()
          Note: In this class, getters and setters are called "Java Beans" as well
        7)If you do not create any setter(), the class will be "immutable class"
