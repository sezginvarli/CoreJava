            Data Types In Java

            1)Primitive Data Types:
                i)Those data types were created by Java, we cannot create any primitive data type
                ii)Primitive data types are 8
                    a)byte - short - int - long - float - double / char - booelan
                        char: It is for single characters like A, h, ?, !, etc.
                        boolean: It is for true-false values

                        byte: It is used for the values from -128 to 127. It is for whole numbers.
                        short: It is ued for the values -32 thousand sth to positive 32 thousand sth. It is for whole numbers.
                        int: It is used for the values -2 billion sth to 2 billion sth. It is for whole numbers.
                        long: It is used for the values from .... to .... It is for whole numbers.

                        float: It is used for decimals. float uses memory less than double.
                               When you create float as data type, you have to put 'F' or 'f' at the end.
                               float has 7 digits at most in decimal part.
                        double: It is used for decimals. double is used for scientific researches.
                               double has 16 digits at most in decimal part.
            2)Non-Primitive Data Types
                1)Those data types can be created by Java and Java Developers.
                String is a non-primitive data type.
                String data type is used for multiple characters.
            Note: What is the difference between "primitive" and "non-primitive" data types?
                i) Primitive data types starts with lower cases, "non-primitive" data types starts with upper cases.
                ii) Primitive data types can be created by Java, but "non-primitive" data types can be created by Java
                and Java Developers.
                iii) Primitive data types use different size of memory, but "non-primitive" data types use memory same.

                iv) Primitive data types have just values in it, but "non-primitive" data types have values and "methods"
                in it.
