        - Type a program that displays all the 7-day earnings of the market on a daily basis.
        - Type a method that calculate the average amount the market earns this week.
        - Type a method that calculate which days market earns above average.
        - Type a method that calculate which days market earns below average.

        Step 1: Create an ArrayList containing the days.
        Step 2: Create an ArrayList to which we will add the daily earnings.
        Step 3: With the while loop, take the 7-day earnings from the user one by one and add them to the daily earnings ArrayList.
        Step 4: Get the average earnings with the method called averageOfEarnings().
        Step 5: Create a method called daysAboveAverage().
                Compare all days with average earnings with for loop.
                If higher than average earnings, return those days.
        Step 6: Create a method called daysBelowAverage().
                Compare all days with average earnings with for loop.
                If less than average earnings, return those days.
